        <div class="bio-text">
            <p> As a child, I have always tried to understand the world around me by questioning why things are the way they are. I am never content with 
                the idea that everything must and will always be how they are now. During summers between school, I would get depressed about not working on anything 
                new or creating something. This pushed me to become self driven in creating projects for myself. I never accepted things to be one dimensional and 
                felt the need to explore every aspect of them. This curiosity and desire to understand have remained fundamental to the person I am and seek to become.

                    I read books, played games like keep the balloon from falling, and guess that celebrity - however, they
                    were celebrities from prior to the 80's so I was a bit lost.
